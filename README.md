# EchoBot - A simple way to add a bot to your Discord server

**EchoBot** is designed to be a way for c# experienced coders to easily make a custom discord bot. 

> **Tip:** For bot hosting instructions, refer to the [deployment guide](https://discordnet.dev/guides/deployment/deployment.html).

## Custom Slash Command Creation

Creating custom slash commands is a breeze with EchoBot. Follow this simplified process to add your own commands.

<summary><b>How to Create a Custom Slash Command</b></summary>
<br>
  
> **Tip:** This tutorial is short and doesnt go into detail. Please refer to the example commands that are built in to get a better understanding on how it works.

#### Step 1: Script Creation

Start by naming your script 'Example'. Hereâ€™s a basic template to create a slash command:

```cs
using System.Linq;
using Discord;
using Discord.Commands;
using Discord.Rest;
using Discord.WebSocket;

public class Example : SlashCommand
{
  public Example()
  {
  }
  public override void HandleExecute(SocketSlashCommand command)
  {
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Command Definition

For recognition and registration, your command must have a name and a description:

```cs
using System.Linq;
using Discord;
using Discord.Commands;
using Discord.Rest;
using Discord.WebSocket;

public class Example : SlashCommand
{
  public Example()
  {
      command.Name = "example";
      command.Description = "This is an example command";
  }
  public override void HandleExecute(SocketSlashCommand command)
  {
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Command Reply

```cs
using System.Linq;
using Discord;
using Discord.Commands;
using Discord.Rest;
using Discord.WebSocket;

public class Example : SlashCommand
{
  public Example()
  {
      command.Name = "example";
      command.Description = "This is an example command";
  }
  public override void HandleExecute(SocketSlashCommand command)
  {
      Reply("You executed the example command!");
  }
}
```

### Text Commands: A Parallel Universe

> **Note:** Ephemeral messages (messages that are hidden from other users) cannot be used with text commands. Please be cautious about the information you display.
> 
Without the need for a description, they are derived from the `TextCommand` class, with a `SocketCommandContext` parameter in the execution method.

## Built-in Commands

EchoBot comes pre-loaded with a suite of commands to kickstart your bot development journey. Here's a snapshot of what's available:
